Splunk Setup: **PICTURES REDACTED**

 

Click through all the default settings until you reach profile page: 

Splunkheem +pinheem 

 

Click the check to openSSH server  

 

It will run installation, and you will be prompted to remove the CDROM  

 

Save a snapshot, and then adjust the boot order to put hard disk first.  

 

Reboot and log in with your username and password you made: 

 

We will need to have a GUI view, so run this for a lightweight option: 

sudo apt install xubuntu-desktop 

 
Download splunk free here: 

https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-cloud.html  

 

 

Do sudo reboot and you should have the GUI for ubuntu-server VM 

 

CD to the downloads directory and run “tar xvzf” on the splunk zip 

 

 

Problem: Help, I need more storage on my VM but don’t want to completely restart 

Solution: 

Go to program files > ORacle > virtualbox > ./Vboxmanage  in powershell 

./VboxManage modifyhd "C:\Users\heemh\VirtualBox VMs\splunk\splunk.vdi" --resize 51200  

This will set the GB to 50 

 

Go to spunk server after unzipping, then go to /bin 

Run ./splunk start 

 

Splunk should now be accessible http://splunk:8000 

 

 

 

Go to the web inteface > Settings > “Forwarding and receiving” > Set up an instance to receive data forward from other instances via port 9997 

 

After, go to settings > “Indexes” > create a new index for “wineventlog” > press “save” 

-This will be used to receive window event logs via splunk universal forwarder from windows DC 

 

Make sure the IP of the splunk server is 192.168.4.15  

 

Receiving Windows Event Logs 

 

Go download “Splunk Universal Forwarder” from the splunk website on your windows 2022 DC server 

Deployment server is an optional step but go ahead and do it anyways, set the port to the default 8089 

 

Setting up receiving indexer is next, make sure this is set to 9997 port which is where we will send our windows event log to Splunk at: 

 

 

Click install to install the Splunk universal forwarder 

 

 

Go back to splunk server > settings > “add data” > “forward”  

 

If you’ve done this step right, you should see the windows DC host under “Available hosts” 

Click that and hit next 

 

 

If you hit next and you do not see “Local Event Logs” as a option to select as source, then you need to go to settings > “Data inputs” > go down to forwarded inputs > select “Windows Event logs” and continue from there 

 

Next step, select ‘wineventlog” as the index 

 

Completed setup: 

 

Go here if you want to add more data to source out from the DC:  

Settings > “data inputs” > “windows event logs”  

To view all logs, go to the search > query index=”wineventlogs” 

Helpful queries: 

Index=”wineventlog”  sourcetype=”wineventlog:security” 

Querying security windows event logs for specific device / user: 

Index=”wineventlog”  sourcetype=”wineventlog:security” Account_Name=”DAVIS-BLACK-PC$” 

 

Problem: My ubuntu server hosting splunk has a different timezone 

 

Solution: 

Check timezone via timedatectl command 

Sudo timedatectl set-timezone America/Indiana/Indianapolis 

sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
