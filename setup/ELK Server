Here is quick overview of this new VM: 

Elasticsearch for storing logs and data. 

Kibana for visualizing the data from Zeek and Suricata. 

Logstash (optional, depending on whether you want to parse and enrich logs before sending to Elasticsearch). 

Zeek for network traffic analysis (metadata on connections, DNS, HTTP, etc.). 

Suricata for intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS) by analyzing traffic for suspicious patterns. 

Go back to 1.7 and source logs from Wazuh Server to the newly ELK VM
