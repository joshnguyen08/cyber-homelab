-The purpose of this project was recommended by Garrett from Central Insurance, it seeks to provide practical application to NDSSEC and DNS over HTTPS. 

-DNS blocking to prevent malicious or privacy-invasive domains from being resolved on your network

check out this repo for a great collection of DNS blocklists to choose from: https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists  

 

Technitium DNS Server is an open source authoritative as well as recursive DNS server that can be used for self hosting a DNS server for privacy & security. It works out-of-the-box with no or minimal configuration and provides a user friendly web console accessible using any modern web browser. 

 

We will use our Splunk VM to host docker container for our DNS server: 

sudo apt update 

sudo apt install docker.io 

sudo systemctl enable --now docker 

 

Verify installation: 

docker –version 

 

Helpful docker commands 

Docker ps – list running containers 

docker ps –a – lists all containers 

Docker stop {container name} 

Docker rm {container name} 

docker start {container name} 

 

 

Grab the docker image: 

Docker pull technitium/dns-server:latest 

 

Now use docker run: 

docker run -d \ 

  --name technitium-dns \ 

  -p 53:53/tcp \ 

  -p 53:53/udp \ 

  -p 5380:5380/tcp \ 

  -v /opt/technitium-dns:/etc/dns/config \ 

  Technitium/dns-server:latest 

 

If there’s an port conflict- 

sudo lsof -i :53 

-use this to check what service is currently using port 53 

 
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved 

sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved 

 

Now use sudo docker ps to see if the container is running, it should be 

Go to http://192.168.4.15:5380 

Change default password for admin 

 

Go to settings -> DNS Server IPv4 Source addresses -> put in 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 

 

Test the functionality of new DNS server: 

nslookup google.com 192.168.4.15 

 

 

 

Now to integrate to our network 

 

Go to pfsense -> system -> general setup -> add 192.168.4.15 to primary DNS 

 

This forces all DNS queries in the network to go to the new Technetium DNS server 

 

Issue now would be our victim subnet doesn’t allow inbound rule to reach technitium DNS server 

We need to allow TCP/UDP port 53 firewalls 

Everything shoujld work now.
