Security Onion  Setup 

 

Let it load up and put in username (heem) and password (PIN+heem)

“2.4.100-20240903 ISO image released on 2024/09/03” 

 

Virtualbox Setup: 

 

 

Set the static IP of the SecOnion server to correspond with pfsense’s subnet of 192.168.2.100/24 

 

Create an account as well (heemanalyst@gmail.com)   + (pin+heem) 

 

Analyst will reside in 192.168.2.15 

 

 

 

Issue: 

 

Solution: I believe this issue was caused because I chose the subnet seconion as the management NIC instead of the NAT. 

Its using secOnion subnet which isn't configured yet in pfsense to perform an installation and it's failing to pull data from an external source while using that NIC. 

 

 

After Security Onion is done, we can now begin with our analyst computer 

 

Follow the steps after this section to learn how to create an analyst machine, and once this is made go back to the secOnion server, use “sudo so-allow" 

 

Create an analyst role for the IP set for that analyst machine, 192.168.1.15 in this case 

 

Analysts should now be able to access the web interface of security onion.  

 

Run sudo so-status to verify everything is up and running: 

 

 

 

 

Security Onion Analyst Machine 

 

Using a Ubuntu Desktop ISO image, create a VM 

 

Pick all default options for initial set-up and configurations 

 

Manually set the IP to an allowed one (the one you set during secOnion installation) 

 

Access the security onion interface via the IP address given after setup of Security Onion VM 

 

IP: 192.168.2.15 

 

Issue: I can’t acces the security onion web interface 

 

 

 

 

 

Solution: 

Try: 

 sudo so-firewall includehost analyst <IP ADDRESS> 

 

Issue: 

So-soc container has “missing” status 

 

Solution: 

Run “sudo so-restart soc” 

 

 

Access the security onion server via 192.168.2.100
