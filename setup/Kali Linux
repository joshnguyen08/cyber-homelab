Kali Linux Setup **PICTURES REDACTED**

 

Download the VirtualBox image for Kali Linux and add it into virtualbox 

 

Make sure it is configured to “kali” internal network adapter on VirtualBox to correspond with pfsense’s subnet for it. 

 

Virtualbox configuration: (image attached)

 

 

Use “passwd” to change default password (pin+heem) 

 

Access the pfsense’s virtual interface via https://192.168.1.1  

Before doing so, make sure kali linux has a set connection utilizing the correct subnet of 192.168.1.1/24 and the default gateway of 192.168.1.1 

 

In my case, Kali Linux is set manually via 192.168.1.10 but DHCP is also enabled on this interface.
