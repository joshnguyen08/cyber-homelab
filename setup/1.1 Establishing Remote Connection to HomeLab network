 

Purpose: Establish a remote connection using VNC (Virtual Network Computing) on my Kali Linux that allows my external Mac to remote in 

 

 

Kali Linux setup (Where we are remoting to) 

 

Install the VNC server using these commands: 

sudo apt update 

sudo apt install tightvncserver 

vncserver  

 

Use this command to kill the process after starting so we can configure it: 

vncserver –kill :1 

 

In your xstartup file located in ~/.vnc/xstartup: 

Put in this line of code to make sure the desktop environment starts: 

startxfce & 

 

Then do: 

chmod +x ~/.vnc/xstartup 

 

Start the VNC server now with a desired resolution, which can be adjusted: 

vncserver –geometry 1280x720 

 

The above will host a VNCserver with a process ID of x, depending on how many you got running 

 

 

Since Kali Linux sits in a pfsense subnet and it has a private IP, we need to set up port forwarding on the pfsense to access the VNC server from the internet 

 

Go to pfsense > Firewall > NAT > Port Forward 

 

Add a rule that uses the WAN interface with TCP protocol, destination of WAN address with a destination port range of only 5901 which constitutes VNC’s default port. 

Redirect Target IP should be set to the private IP of the kali linux VM and port 5901 

Apply and save changes, it should look like the picture below: 

 

 

 

In order to secure our connection, we have to use openSSH to tunnel the VNC connection over SSH 

 

Sudo apt install openssh-server 

Sudo systemctl start ssh 

Sudo systemctl enable ssh 

 

 

Access remotely: 

ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 username@<pfSense_Public_IP> 

 

 

However, my WAN interface is behind a double NAT configuration so this will be more challenging, will leave for now.
