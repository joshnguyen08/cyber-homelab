1.4 Implement Wazuh Server and Agents for HIDS/HIPS 

https://blog.securityonion.net/2023/08/security-onion-24-has-reached-general.html  

 

https://docs.securityonion.net/en/2.4/elastic-fleet.html  

Evaluation mode in Security Onion does not support adding Elastic agents. Evaluation mode is designed for a quick installation for testing Security Onion, but it is not intended for production use. 

 

We will find another solution to employ, preferably free and open source for security agents.  

 

Wazuh and its agent? https://wazuh.com/

Run this command to install Wazuh server: 

 

curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.9/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a 

 

It will install indexer, server, and dashboard components 

User: admin 

Password: r7XYeKlkPd89a+l+uM3VjasH.MDuy1ut 

 

Access Wazuh through loopback IP – https://127.0.0.1:443 

 

You can change this but you first have to do: 

Sudo tar –xvf wazuh-install-files.tar 

Sudo nano config.yml 

 

Now you can change IP 

 

I assigned each of the 3 servers to 192.168.2.101  

 

TODO: need to figure out bug, need to adjust IP as it still starts up on loopback interface
