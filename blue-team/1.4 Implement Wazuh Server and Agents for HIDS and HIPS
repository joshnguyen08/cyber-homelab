Evaluation mode in Security Onion does not support adding Elastic agents. Evaluation mode is designed for a quick installation for testing Security Onion, but it is not intended for production use. 

 

We will find another solution to employ, preferably free and open source for security agents.  

 

Wazuh and its agent? https://wazuh.com/  

 

https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/index.html  

 

Run this command to install Wazuh server: 

 

curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.9/wazuh-install.sh && sudo bash ./wazuh-install.sh -a 

 

It will install indexer, server, and dashboard components 

User: admin 

Password: QKm6tKMd1Uq2iZfDsFC.L*L6+w021qCu 

 

Access Wazuh through loopback IP – https://127.0.0.1:443 

 

You can change this but you first have to do: 

Sudo tar –xvf wazuh-install-files.tar 

Sudo nano config.yml 

 

Now you can change IP 

 

I assigned each of the 3 servers to 192.168.2.150 - which is my Wazuh analyst VM static IP  

 

Endpoint Wazuh Agent Deployment 

We will now deploy a wazuh agent 

 

Go to the wazuh server based on your IP above > server management> endpoint summary > “Deploy new agent” 

 

Select the OS to install the agent on, windows in this case. 

 

Then set the server address to 192.168.2.150, this is where the agent connects to 

 

Set the group as “default” for now with agent name left alone as well 

 

Now you’re instructed to run a command through powershell on the endpoint device, go ahead and do this 

 

 

Then do “NET START WazuhSvc” 

 

See picture below for successful deployment: 

 

 

Go back to the Wazuh server and you should see a new endpoint detected as active 

 

Wazuh endpoint agents have been deployed to the DC server and windows 11 enterprise domain user (2 deployments in total) 

 

TODO: Use the configuration assessment to perform endpoint hardening
